Ugxa4ia7lMCQf8ZiukB4AaABAg,rng_yUSwrgU,@rickteen0989,I love that the gap is closing especially for us more broke people haha I feel they tried to close that a little with the minor upgrades each year but I'm happy to get the base without missing out on the things I enjoy I love the fast charging mainly and the screen and it's also lighter perfect but also so powerful and I heard the a19 is as quick if not quicker than the a18 pro chip from last year's 16 pro,0,10 hours ago

However, I am a little disappointed that you didn't bring up the 16 pro in this review as an alternative instead of the 17. They have the same screen, the 17 is just a little bit brighter. The 16 pro has a telephoto but not the new selfie camera. They are very similar and I expected you to bring it up in this review. Do you think that it is worth to get the 17 over the 16 pro?",1,2 days ago

UgylX0zMHPSGjPgjAgl4AaABAg,rng_yUSwrgU,@AllyssaButhmann,"I just went from an iPhone 14 Pro Max to an iPhone 17 base, and the only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù I have is screen size. I lost a little bit of screen size, but for my stubby fingers, it‚Äôs actually become a blessing in disguise. The little bit small size means I can do more, on my phone, with only one hand. I have significant carpal tunnel in both hand, and reaching with my dominant thumb was starting to becoming painful from over stretching. With the slightly smaller screen, i don‚Äôt have to stretch as much. When I first went to look at upgrading, I wrote down a list of important things that I need vs. want, and the base iPhone 17 met all those features. If I want a bigger screen, I can mirror to my TV or get out my iPad. If I need more advanced photo editing, I can easily switch to my Mac Mini. I didn‚Äôt need all the bells and whistles that I needed when I chose the iPhone 14 Pro Max. I‚Äôm a few days into this new phone, and I haven‚Äôt found a feature on the base model that I miss that was exclusive to the Pro models. Maybe my 14 Pro Max was outdated enough to make me think that the 17 is amazing, but so far, I got a phone at half the price and I‚Äôm missing nothing!",1,2 days ago
